## 🛠️ Project – Calculator + Theme Switcher + Live Character Counter

This project combines 3 real-world interactive components using JS functions and event listeners:

### 1️⃣ Simple Calculator
- Takes two numbers as input
- Performs +, –, ×, ÷ operations on button click
- Displays the result dynamically

### 2️⃣ Theme Toggle Button
- A button toggles dark/light mode by applying CSS classes

### 3️⃣ Live Character Counter
- Tracks character count while typing in a `<textarea>`

## 💬 Reflection

This was my first step into making web pages truly interactive. It helped me understand how to structure my JavaScript into reusable functions and respond to user actions through events.
