# 🧠 Day 16 – JavaScript Loops & Object Iteration

On Day 16 of my Full Stack Web Development training at **BS Digital Technology, Durg**, I deepened my understanding of **JavaScript loops**, especially how to iterate through **arrays and objects** effectively.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- `for...of` vs `for...in` loops
- Looping over arrays and objects
- Difference between `forEach` and `for` loops
- Use of `continue` and `break`
- Why `forEach` cannot be broken early
- How to loop through object properties safely using `for...in` + `hasOwnProperty`

## 🛠️ Project – 📊 Student Report Card Generator

This project takes an **array of student objects** and renders a clean, informative **report card** for each student using loop techniques.

### 🔍 Features:

- Loops through students using `forEach()`
- Loops through each subject using `for...in`
- Calculates total and average marks
- Assigns grades: A, B, C, or F
- Displays Pass/Fail status
- Uses DOM manipulation to render all cards

## 💡 Reflection

This project helped me solidify my grasp on looping through arrays and nested objects in JavaScript. I also practiced how to structure and display dynamic data in a clean, responsive layout using the DOM.
