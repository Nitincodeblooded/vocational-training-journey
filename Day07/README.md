# 🧭 Day 7 – Layouts & Positioning in CSS

Welcome to Day 7 of my Full Stack Web Development training with **BS Digital Technology, Durg**.  
Today I focused on mastering how HTML elements are **displayed, positioned, and layered** using CSS.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ `display`: block, inline, inline-block, none
- ✅ `position`: static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky
- ✅ `float` and `clear`
- ✅ `z-index` and stacking contexts

## 🛠️ Practical Work

- 🔹 Built a **navigation bar** using `inline-block`
- 🔹 Designed a **multi-column services section** using `float`
- 🔹 Added a **“back to top” button** using `position: fixed`
- 🔹 Created a **hero section** with text using `position: absolute` over a background image

## 💬 Reflection

CSS positioning opens up **total layout control**. I now understand how `absolute`, `relative`, and `fixed` impact elements and when to use `float` vs `inline-block`. The "back to top" button was my favorite part!
