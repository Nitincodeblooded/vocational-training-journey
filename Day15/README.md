# 🔁 Day 15 – JavaScript Arrays & Loops with DOM

On Day 15 of my Full Stack Web Development training at **BS Digital Technology, Durg**, I explored how to use **JavaScript arrays and loops** to dynamically render content on a web page. This marked the beginning of building data-driven interfaces.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Creating and iterating through arrays
- Array methods: `push`, `pop`, `splice`, `shift`, `unshift`
- Iteration using: `for`, `forEach`, `map`
- Rendering HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript and the DOM

## 🛠️ Project – Product Gallery 🛍️

This mini project displays a list of products using an array of objects. Each product has:
- a name
- a price
- a placeholder image

JavaScript dynamically renders all cards using `.forEach()`.

📂 Files:  
- [index.html](./product-gallery/index.html)  
- [styles.css](./product-gallery/styles.css)  
- [script.js](./product-gallery/script.js)

## 💡 Reflection

JavaScript arrays are extremely powerful when it comes to rendering lists and working with user-generated or dynamic data. By looping through arrays and injecting elements into the DOM, I can now create fully dynamic frontends.
