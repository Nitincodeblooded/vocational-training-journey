# 💰 Day 18 – Expense Tracker with Filters

On Day 18 of my Full Stack Web Development training at **BS Digital Technology, Durg**, I built an interactive **Expense Tracker** that uses **arrays**, **filtering**, and **optional chaining** to dynamically display categorized spending data.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Looping through arrays using `forEach`
- Filtering data with `.filter()`
- Calculating totals using `.reduce()`
- Using optional chaining `?.` to safely access optional data
- Conditional styling for visual feedback
- DOM manipulation with event listeners

## 🛠️ Project – Expense Tracker with Category Filters

This project displays a list of expenses grouped by category. It allows users to filter expenses by category and calculates the total amount spent. It gracefully handles missing optional notes using `?.`.

### 🔍 Features:

- Filter expenses by category (Food, Transport, Electronics, etc.)
- Highlights high-value expenses (`> ₹1000`)
- Displays optional notes (e.g., purpose, tag) using `optional chaining`
- Calculates total expense dynamically

## 💡 Reflection

Today’s project helped me connect multiple real-world concepts: filtering data, calculating totals, handling optional values safely with `?.`, and dynamically updating the UI with JavaScript.
